# COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-of-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Crowd-Detection
This research delves into the applications CNNs in crowd counting and tracking, a domain critical for optimizing operations, ensuring safety, and making informed decisions in diverse industries. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this study assesses four prominent models, namely YOLOv5, YOLOv8, RetinaNET, and RTMDet, against two datasets encompassing varied crowd densities.
Our findings highlight YOLOv8 as the optimal choice due to its exceptional accuracy, precision, and F1-score, making it ideal for crowd counting, detection, and tracking. The integration of BYTE Tracker further enhances YOLOv8's performance, ensuring precise individual tracking within crowded scenes.
